## Features ✨

- 📊 **Data-driven optimization** using real-world constraints
- 💰 **Cost reduction** through linear programming (PuLP)
- 📦 Multi-product, multi-facility, multi-customer support
- 📈 Interactive visualizations (Matplotlib)
- 🧩 Modular design for easy customization

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-optimizer.git
   cd supply-chain-optimizer
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage 🚀
1. Prepare your CSV files in the data/ directory:

Facilities, Customers, Products

Transportation Costs, Demand, Capacity

2. Run the optimizer:

python run.py
View results in:

outputs/shipment_schedules/optimal_plan.csv

outputs/visualizations/ (charts and graphs)

Sample Data Structure 📂
data/
├── facilities.csv        # [facility_id, location, type]
├── customers.csv         # [customer_id, name, region]
├── products.csv          # [product_id, name, weight]
├── transport_costs.csv   # [facility_id, customer_id, cost_per_unit]
├── demand.csv            # [customer_id, product_id, demand]
└── capacity.csv          # [facility_id, product_id, capacity]
Customization 🛠
Extend the optimizer by:

1. Adding new constraints in src/optimizer.py:

# Example: Minimum shipment quantity constraint
self.problem += x[f,c,p] >= min_quantity, f"MinShip_{f}_{c}_{p}"

2. Modifying visualizations in src/visualization.py

Example Output 📊

=== Optimization Results ===
Total Cost: $48,250.00
Savings vs Baseline: 18.7%
Top 5 Shipments:
1. F1 → C3 (P2): 450 units
2. F2 → C1 (P1): 500 units
3. F3 → C2 (P3): 300 units
